### Hi there 👋🏾
Welcome to my timeline. My name is Madona Syombua and I enjoy building Mobile Applications using Kotlin | I still play with Java but we had to part ways. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, and I love it so far.
- You can download my app Budgeting Buddy here [Budgeting Buddy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madonasyombua.budgetbuddy)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving some random Math problems to keep me occupied
